# The-Hemmingway

Project by Jesse Rosart-Brodnitz and Shanley Mullen. 

The Robotic Cat Paw simulates kinematics and dynamics of a polydactyl cat paw with pneumatic extendable claws that is attachable to the UR5 robot arm. The cat paw was designed in Autodesk Inventor and then imported into Matlab to simulate forward and inverse kinematics. This project started being built physically but moved to simulation due to COVID 19. A DC motor opens and closes the gripper. The claws connect to the plungers of syringes. These syringes connect via tubing to a large syringe that operates by a linear actuator. All of the parts work together to allow the robot to pick up small objects and keys.

The Matlab code was done by Shanley Mullen
The Matlab GUI and CAD was done by Jesse Rosart-Brodnitz
